# MyAlarmy
 
MyAlarmy is an innovative alarm clock app designed to ensure you wake up fully alert by requiring a math solution to stop the alarm. Instead of a simple snooze button, users must solve a math problem to turn off the alarm, preventing oversleeping and improving cognitive function in the morning.

This is My Submission for Swift Coding Challenge 2025.
